### Bus Tracking System
 
 
## “real-time” bus tracking system can monitor the movement of buses on a map. Data such as the speed of the bus, the distance covered, the remaining distance to its destination, and the number of scheduled stops is received by Fleet managers in real-time. This helps them take corrective action should there be any deviations or delays. An essential part of bus tracking is the college-bus segment since it is greatly beneficial for college authorities to monitor their students' safe transit using flutter for the front end and javascript for the back end.

## first phase (on going):
1. Components:
    - Arduino uno.
    - SIM 808 GPS/GPRS
    - LED
    - push button
    
2. The wiring schematic: ![this is an image](https://github.com/NaNo211/RoBust/blob/main/1.png)
3. choose the database.we used mongoose database
4. Developing the backend logic using javascript 
5. Developing the front logic using flutter
6. integrate both backend and frontend together
